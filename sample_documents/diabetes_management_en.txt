Type 2 Diabetes Management Guidelines

Overview:
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Proper management requires a comprehensive approach combining lifestyle modifications, regular monitoring, and pharmacological interventions when necessary.

Lifestyle Modifications:

1. Dietary Management
   - Emphasize consumption of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables
   - Limit refined carbohydrates and added sugars
   - Control portion sizes to maintain healthy body weight
   - Consider medical nutrition therapy with a registered dietitian
   - Aim for consistent carbohydrate intake across meals

2. Physical Activity
   - Recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week
   - Include resistance training 2-3 times per week
   - Encourage reduction of sedentary behavior
   - Monitor blood glucose before and after exercise

3. Weight Management
   - Target 5-10% weight loss for overweight or obese patients
   - Regular weight monitoring and tracking
   - Behavioral interventions and support groups

Monitoring:

1. Blood Glucose Monitoring
   - Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) as appropriate
   - Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for eligible patients
   - HbA1c testing every 3 months for patients not at goal
   - Target HbA1c: generally <7%, individualized based on patient factors

2. Complication Screening
   - Annual comprehensive eye examination
   - Annual foot examination
   - Regular screening for nephropathy (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio)
   - Cardiovascular risk assessment

Pharmacological Treatment:

1. First-Line Therapy
   - Metformin is the preferred initial pharmacologic agent
   - Start at low dose and titrate gradually to minimize GI side effects
   - Continue unless contraindicated or not tolerated

2. Additional Agents
   - Consider adding agents based on individual patient characteristics
   - Options include sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors
   - For patients with established cardiovascular disease, prioritize agents with proven cardiovascular benefit
   - Insulin therapy when needed to achieve glycemic targets

Patient Education:
- Provide comprehensive diabetes self-management education
- Teach recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia
- Educate about sick day management
- Discuss long-term complications and prevention strategies

Follow-up:
- Quarterly visits for patients not at glycemic goal
- Biannual visits for stable patients at goal
- Assess medication adherence, lifestyle modifications, and barriers to care
- Adjust treatment plan as needed based on HbA1c and other clinical parameters
