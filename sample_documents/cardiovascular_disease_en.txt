Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Management

Introduction:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Prevention and early management are critical to reducing morbidity and mortality. This guideline covers risk assessment, primary prevention, and management strategies.

Risk Assessment:

1. Risk Factors
   - Non-modifiable: Age, sex, family history
   - Modifiable: Hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity

2. Risk Calculation
   - Use validated risk calculators (e.g., Framingham Risk Score, ASCVD Risk Calculator)
   - Assess 10-year risk of major cardiovascular events
   - Stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories

3. Screening Tests
   - Blood pressure measurement
   - Lipid panel (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides)
   - Fasting blood glucose or HbA1c
   - ECG in selected patients
   - Additional tests based on risk factors

Primary Prevention:

1. Lifestyle Modifications
   - Heart-healthy diet (Mediterranean or DASH diet)
   - Regular physical activity (150 minutes moderate intensity per week)
   - Weight management (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m²)
   - Smoking cessation
   - Moderate alcohol consumption
   - Stress management

2. Blood Pressure Management
   - Target: <130/80 mmHg for most adults
   - More intensive targets for high-risk patients
   - Lifestyle modifications first-line for stage 1 hypertension
   - Pharmacotherapy for stage 2 or high-risk stage 1

3. Lipid Management
   - LDL cholesterol targets based on risk category
   - Statins as first-line therapy
   - Consider additional agents if targets not met (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors)
   - Monitor for side effects and medication adherence

4. Diabetes Management
   - Target HbA1c <7% for most patients
   - Preferred agents with cardiovascular benefit in high-risk patients
   - Comprehensive management of all cardiovascular risk factors

5. Antiplatelet Therapy
   - Consider low-dose aspirin for primary prevention in selected high-risk patients
   - Weigh benefits against bleeding risk
   - Generally not recommended for low-risk individuals

Secondary Prevention:

For patients with established CVD:

1. Intensive Risk Factor Management
   - More aggressive LDL targets (<70 mg/dL or <55 mg/dL for very high risk)
   - Strict blood pressure control
   - Optimal glycemic control in diabetics
   - Mandatory smoking cessation

2. Antiplatelet Therapy
   - Aspirin 75-100 mg daily unless contraindicated
   - Consider dual antiplatelet therapy post-acute coronary syndrome (typically 12 months)

3. Beta-Blockers
   - Indicated post-myocardial infarction
   - For heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
   - Consider in stable coronary artery disease

4. ACE Inhibitors/ARBs
   - Indicated for heart failure
   - For post-MI patients with reduced ejection fraction
   - For patients with diabetes and CVD

5. Cardiac Rehabilitation
   - Comprehensive program including exercise, education, and counseling
   - Proven to reduce mortality and improve quality of life

Special Populations:

1. Women
   - Pregnancy-related risk factors (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes)
   - Menopause and hormonal considerations
   - Atypical presentation of acute coronary syndromes

2. Elderly
   - Individualized risk assessment
   - Consider life expectancy and functional status
   - Balance benefits and risks of interventions

3. Chronic Kidney Disease
   - Modified risk stratification
   - Careful medication selection
   - Monitor for drug-drug interactions

Acute Coronary Syndromes:

1. Recognition
   - Chest pain or discomfort (may be atypical)
   - Associated symptoms: dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea
   - ECG changes
   - Elevated cardiac biomarkers

2. Emergency Management
   - Immediate aspirin unless contraindicated
   - Rapid assessment and triage
   - Reperfusion therapy if indicated (PCI or thrombolysis)
   - Supportive care

3. Post-Event Management
   - Intensive risk factor modification
   - Cardiac rehabilitation
   - Medication optimization
   - Regular follow-up

Heart Failure Management:

1. Diagnosis
   - Clinical symptoms and signs
   - Echocardiography to assess ejection fraction
   - BNP/NT-proBNP levels
   - Identify underlying cause

2. Pharmacologic Treatment (HFrEF)
   - ACE inhibitor or ARB
   - Beta-blocker
   - Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist
   - SGLT-2 inhibitor
   - Consider ARNi (sacubitril/valsartan)

3. Device Therapy
   - ICD for primary or secondary prevention
   - CRT for selected patients with wide QRS

4. Lifestyle Management
   - Sodium restriction (<2-3 g/day)
   - Fluid management
   - Daily weight monitoring
   - Exercise training

Patient Education:

- Understanding cardiovascular risk factors
- Recognizing warning signs of acute events
- Medication adherence
- Lifestyle modification strategies
- When to seek emergency care

Follow-up and Monitoring:

- Regular visits based on risk level and stability
- Periodic reassessment of cardiovascular risk
- Monitoring for medication side effects
- Screening for depression and cognitive impairment
- Coordination with specialists as needed
